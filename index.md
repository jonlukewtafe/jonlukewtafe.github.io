##### Keeping Track of Packages in Python Projects (AKA Freezing Requirements)
  * Freezing requirements allows for simple installation of packages upon a Python program/application being pulled from Git (or similar).
  * In order to freeze requirements, run: `pip freeze > requirements.txt` This will print a list of Python packages that are currently being used/installed as a part of the current project to the file `requirements.txt`.
  * Ensure that this is done prior to submission of any assessment work that uses packages as it makes it simple to install the required packages, requiring only a single command once the application is pulled from Git (or similar)
    * The command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
